- I have finished implementing parts 1, 2 and 3 of the assignment. The
program should work as intended.

- I would recommend you to test all the functionalities of part 1, 2, and 3 of 
the assignment of the program before testing part 4 as part 4 is only 
partial done. In particular, if you choose a ship or multiple ships 
and do the rotation, they should rotated as expected. However, after they 
rotated, if you group any of them up, the bounding box that wraps around the 
group will become incorrect. Besides, if you do the rotation on a group, the 
behavior is not correct (elements in the group will rotate around their own 
center instead of around the center of the bounding box). 

Thank you!
