What I have done

- Part 1: 	Everything

- Part 2: 	Everything

- Part 3: 	Everything(z-order, selection box around objects, deletion, moving)

	EXCEPT resizing. 
	However, I have set up all the necessary steps for it(including 
	states and handle cases). The missing part is a small portion of the
	implementation (specifically line 46 and line 123 in 
	DrawingController). It's almost done but due to time constraint I 
	could not get it done on time.
	
	Also note that there is a small bug when user choose the line shape 
	in the shape toolbar and left click (press and release without
	dragging). A small point would appear on the screen without the 
	small yellow circle handle at the corner. This bug causes by line 
	83-90 in the DrawingController but I don't have enough time to fix it
	
- Part 4:	Mostly left undone. Moving around the world view was set up at line
	31 in DrawingController (without the implementation).
	

NOTE: Choose a shape from the shape toolbar and a color from the color toolbar
before drawing
